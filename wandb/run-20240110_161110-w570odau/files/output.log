/home/shangjian/miniconda3/envs/pro/lib/python3.8/site-packages/trl/trainer/sft_trainer.py:214: UserWarning: You passed a tokenizer with `padding_side` not equal to `right` to the SFTTrainer. This might lead to some unexpected behaviour due to overflow issues when training a model in half-precision. You might consider adding `tokenizer.padding_side = 'right'` to your code.
