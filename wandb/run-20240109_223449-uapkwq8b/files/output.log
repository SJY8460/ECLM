You're using a LlamaTokenizerFast tokenizer. Please note that with a fast tokenizer, using the `__call__` method is faster than using a method to encode the text followed by a call to the `pad` method to get a padded encoding.
Asking to truncate to max_length but no maximum length is provided and the model has no predefined maximum length. Default to no truncation.
